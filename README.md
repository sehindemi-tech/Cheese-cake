🍰 Classic Baked Cheesecake Recipe
📝 Ingredients:

For the base:

    200g digestive biscuits (or graham crackers)

    100g unsalted butter, melted

For the filling:

    600g full-fat cream cheese (e.g., Philadelphia)

    100g icing sugar or caster sugar

    200ml double cream

    2 tsp vanilla extract

    2 eggs

    1 tbsp plain flour (optional for extra firmness)

For topping (optional):

    Fresh berries

    Fruit compote or sauce

    Dusting of icing sugar

🧑‍🍳 Equipment:

    20cm (8-inch) springform cake tin

    Mixing bowls

    Electric whisk or stand mixer

    Rubber spatula

    Oven

🔪 Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Prepare the base

    Crush the biscuits into fine crumbs using a food processor or by placing them in a zip-lock bag and bashing with a rolling pin.

    Mix the crumbs with melted butter until evenly coated.

    Press the mixture firmly into the base of the springform tin.

    Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes while you prepare the filling.

2. Preheat your oven

    Set your oven to 160°C fan / 180°C conventional / 350°F / Gas mark 4.

3. Make the filling

    In a bowl, beat the cream cheese and sugar until smooth.

    Add the eggs one at a time, beating after each addition.

    Mix in the double cream, vanilla extract, and flour (if using) until smooth and creamy.

4. Assemble

    Pour the cheesecake mixture over the chilled biscuit base.

    Smooth the top with a spatula.

5. Bake

    Place the tin on a baking tray and bake for 45–55 minutes. The edges should be set, and the middle should have a slight wobble.

    Turn off the oven and let the cheesecake cool inside the oven for an hour with the door slightly open (this helps prevent cracking).

6. Chill

    After cooling, transfer to the fridge and chill for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight.

7. Serve

    Run a knife around the edge before releasing the springform.

    Top with fresh fruit, compote, or a dusting of icing sugar.
